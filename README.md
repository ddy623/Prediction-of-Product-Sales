# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

By: Deidre Hunt

Business Problem:
What products at a grocery store has the most impact on sales?

Data:
The data shows that some items were sold more than others and that item visibility played a role in sales.  The target of the project was outlet_sales and the features of the assignment were: Item_Weight, Item_Visibility, Item_MRP, and Outlet Establishment Year.  

Methods:
Regression Models were used to predict sales such as Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Trees.

Results:
Based upon the data, we were able to see that Item Weight, Item MRP and Item Visibility played a much greater role on sales than Item Fat Content or Item Type. We were also able to see that using a Random Forest Tree Model showed that there was a slight variation.
